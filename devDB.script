INSERT INTO BLOG_ENTRY VALUES(418,0,TRUE,3,'<p>\u000aAs a developer, if you''ve every used Skype, you gotta be thinking... "wonder if there''s an API for this thing...". Well the answer is "yes", but not in a format that''s like anything you''ve used before!\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aThe good news is that pretty much anything that you can do with Skype can be automated from the public api (and in a documented way).

You can grab the api docs from the <a href="http://share.skype.com/share/developer_blog/">Skype Developer page</a>.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aOn Win32, the API works but using SendMessage calls to the Skype window (ie putting stuff directly on its message queue).  There are also GTK equivalents that use freedesktop DBus to do similar. So it''s pretty darn ugly stuff - you end up copying API commands onto the queue (as strings... like the way you used to drive an AT modem!), and off they go. Skype has to be started and visible (part of the API license is that it has to remain visible), so no clean options there for a silent skype in the background.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aSo how do you call it from Java?

I installed the (very cool) <a href="http://www.khaoslabs.com/activeskype.php">ActiveSkype</a> COM library from KhaosLabs that defines all the constants and strings you need.

So I''m iterating over <code>request.getCookies()</code> and finding the relevant cookie to delete, then calling <code>setMaxAge(0)</code> to expire it immediately. What could go wrong?\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aWell... the cookie wasn''t disappearing. These things can be a bit of a bugger to track down since you need to see the browser and response headers to work out what is going on. The tool I like best for this is <a href="http://www.blunck.info/iehttpheaders.html">ieHttpHeaders</a> (an IE equivalent of <a href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">livehttpheaders</a>). \u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aMy first drama was that I wasn''t seeing the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header come back to the browser to delete the cookie. Hmm... seems you''ve got to add the cookie to the response once you do the <code>setMaxAge(0)</code> on it. Probably should have known that. No biggy... Try again...\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aOk. Now I see the <code>Set-Cookie</code> coming back to the browser header to kill off the cookie, but on then next request, the browser is still sending the cookie to the server! After much stuffing around I noticed that when I created the cookie, the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header has a path and domain, but when I delete the cookie there''s no such beast. You''d think I could call <code>Cookie.getDomain()</code> and <code>Cookie.getPath()</code> on the cookie I retrieve from the request. No cigar. The browser doesn''t tell you that stuff, so you just get nulls.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aSo then I changed my deleteCookie routine to call the same code that generated the Cookie in the first place (with domain, path, and age), and call <code>setMaxAge(0)</code> on that and add it to the response.  All good. \u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aThe moral of the story is that <code>setMaxAge(0)</code> only does what you think it does if the path and domain match the ones you used to set the cookie in the first place.

INSERT INTO BLOG_ENTRY VALUES(438,0,TRUE,3,'<p>\u000aI admit it. This week is the first time I''ve ever used <code>java.util.logging</code>. I''ve pretty much always used commons logging and log4j for all my logging needs since one of them was already a dependency in a supporting library, and I''ve never really had a reason to look elsewhere.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aTill now...\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aI''ve had reason to work on some code that integrates into Websphere''s Member Manager stuff. This code is way down in the  WAS stack, and if I wanted to use log4j, I''d have to drag it into /lib/ext.... which means that everyone on that app server is now using my version of log4j. Not so sweet.   \u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aMy next thought was to use Commons Logging (JCL). WAS5.1 uses commons logging internally, and I could get it into WAS6, but I found there are <a href="http://www.qos.ch/logging/classloader.jsp">all sorts of classloader issues</a> with it when /lib/ext comes into play. So that was off the list.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aFinally I did some digging and discovered that WAS6 has switched to <code>java.util.logging</code> for all its logging goodness. Read a <a href="http://www.javapractices.com/Topic143.cjp">few</a> <a href="http://www.crazysquirrel.com/computing/java/logging.jspx">good</a> <a  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/util/logging/overview.html">\u000aarticles</a> and I was good to go. Had to get used to the idea of Loggers, Handlers and Formatters and how they hung together. but it wasn''t much of a switch really. You end up doing stuff like: \u000a<pre>\u000aLogger myLogger = Logger.getLogger(myClass.class.getName());\u000a</pre>\u000aalong with a:\u000a<pre>\u000aif (myLogger.isLoggable(Level.FINE))\u000a    myLogger.log(Level.FINE, "Try catching this", e);\u000a</pre>\u000aSeems that the log method does some reflection to see what method are logging from. Not sure of the performance implications of that one under load... the IBM docs recommend using the <code>logp()</code> version of the call for just that reason... but we''ll see. The basic Formatter is pretty average (two line log messages!), but it''s pluggable so you can probably simulate a log4j console appender if you were that keen. The standard ConsoleAppender goes to stderr which I found a bit annoying and haven''t work out how to fix just yet.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aThe only bit I found generally confusing was how you actually configure it declaritively. You can edit <code>logging.properties</code> in your JRE, but that''s a little overkill. You can supply -D args to your command line for a config file or config class... but that''s not going to work for my /lib/ext story.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aThen I found that WAS6 provides <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/ttrb_configjavalog.html">cute ways</a> to modify your log levels dynamically on a per logger basis straight from the admin console. This is ideal for a /lib/ext app where you want to wind up logging every so often and debug a problem... but you don''t want an outage on the app server.  \u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aAnyways... I''m not sure java.util.logging deserves the bad wrap that it gets. It certainly doesn''t have the prebuild flexibility of log4j with <code>DailyRollingFileWithAChocolateToppingLogAppenders</code>, but for the basics it does plenty (including the equivalent of a RollingFileAppender), and definitely hits the sweet spot for Websphere /lib/ext uses.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aWorth exploring...\u000a</p>','2006-04-07 07:05:21.557000000','','html',FALSE,'','There *are* things to love about java.util.logging...')

Sample below:</p>\u000a<p><img alt="Autocomplete in CyaThen.com" src="images/2006/YahooAutocomplete.gif" /></p>\u000a<p>I''ve been really impressed with how customisable Yahoo have made it. You can wire up the datasource to be Ajax (which is the way I went since Grails makes the xml generation so easy), or an in-page array. You can apply all kinda fades and delays and caching and... well, check out their <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/autocomplete/customize.html">example page</a> to see all the customise options.</p>\u000a<p>Thought it might be useful to other grails guys to jot down the steps I needed to go through to get it happening. This only applied to Grails 0.2, the file might be already included in a future version.</p>\u000a<p>1.&nbsp;You need to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/yui">download</a> the Yahoo components from sourceforge since Grails 0.2 didn''t include the autocomplete_min.js file that you need. Track down that file and copy it into the /web-app/js/yahoo directory in your grails app.</p>\u000a<p>2. Edit the JavaScript TagLib.groovy and make sure the yahoo map is edited to include ''yahoo/autocomplete-min''&nbsp; (note their is no .js on the end of that one)</p>\u000a<p>3. Inside the view that you want&nbsp;to have an autocomplete field, edit your html &lt;head&gt; element to include &lt;g:javascript library=&quot;yahoo&quot; /&gt; which will pull in all the Javascript you need.</p>\u000a<p>4. Add a script element that will tell wire up your input element to your backend XML datasource. Here''s what mine looks like:</p>\u000a<pre>&lt;script&gt;   \u000a    var myDataSource = new YAHOO.widget.DS_XHR(&quot;search&quot;, [&quot;person&quot;, &quot;name&quot;]);  \u000a    myDataSource.responseType = myDataSource.TYPE_XML; \u000a    var myAutoComp = new YAHOO.widget.AutoComplete(''numbers'',''customcontainer'', myDataSource);   \u000a    myAutoComp.delimChar = &quot;,&quot;  \u000a&lt;/script&gt; \u000a</pre>\u000a<p>This piece of magic tells the yahoo component to call my &quot;search&quot; action, and expect the returned XML to have an array of &quot;person&quot; elements, each with a &quot;name&quot; field to display. The autocomplete line wires up that datasource to my &quot;numbers&quot; input box using the empty &quot;customcontainer&quot; DIV to display the funky slidy autocomplete list.</p>\u000a<p>5. Finally, you just need to create a Grails on your current controller to create the XML. You''ll get the user''s query is params.query and you need to return some well formed XML that the autocomplete can parse. With a builder that couldn''t be easier. </p>\u000a<pre>def search = {\u000a    \u0009\u0009\u000a  def str = params.query?.toUpperCase()\u000a  println &quot;Searching for $str&quot;;\u000a  // do your custom stuff here\u000a  render(contentType: &quot;text/xml&quot;) {\u000a    addressbook() {\u000a        for (c in acc.contacts) {\u000a            if (c.fullName().toUpperCase() =~ /${str}/ || c.mobile =~ /${str}/) {\u000a                person() {\u000a\u0009    \u0009    name(c.fullName() + &quot; (&quot; + c.mobile + &quot;)&quot;)\u000a\u0009    \u0009}\u000a    \u0009    }\u000a    \u0009 }\u000a    }\u000a  }\u000a}\u000a</pre>\u000a<p>If I could work out a better way to make the regexps case insenitive that''d look a lot smoother... but you get the idea.

This component wraps a real browser (ie on windows, Safari on OSX, and Firefox on Linux). It means I can run my thumbnail server on whatever box I like (though the Linux routines produce a significantly more jagged images...). My Java code launches a new shell containing a browser component, points it at a URL, waited until browser component fires its "all done" event, then grabs an Image of the component and writes it to a JPEG.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aWhy does it generate JPEGs and not PNGs/GIFs? I''ve tried all the formats, but JPEG is the only one that works with all of the websites I''ve sampled. I haven''t got to the bottom of it yet, but the SWT libraries on OSX seems to write PNGs that have a bit-depth that is too complex for some browsers. And if won''t generate GIFs for sites with complex bit-depths at all! Both those cases only happen for a percentage of sites... but enough to be a pain. I haven''t found a site that won''t JPEG reliably, so I''m sticking with that (and the thumbnails are quite a lot smaller in file size, though there is a little artifacting).\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aWhen can you get the source? Real soon now... The upgrade to Grails 1.0 RC1 clobbered my build.xml file which builds my distro.zip... and my CVS server is only freshly restored from backup, so I have to hunt down the old version. But I should have something next week for people to download and play with if they''re keen.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aThe SWT stuff that does the browser grab is written in Java, but exposed by a XML RPC service written in Groovy. I wanted to do all the funky browser-launching stuff in a separate VM from the app server, and XMLRPC was such an easy option with the <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/XMLRPC">Groovy XMLRPC</a> module. Things get even trickier cause my server is OSX, and SWT needs a special JVM switch of -XstartOnFirstThread, so it was pretty compelling to have it as a standalone service.

INSERT INTO BLOG_ENTRY VALUES(547,0,TRUE,3,'<p>\u000aI used to be a hardcore DOM-style man, and <a href="http://www.dom4j.org">dom4j</a> remains my favourite XML API, but these days I''ve been doing a lot of performance and load sensitive stuff in the middle tier, which means that I tend to go for streaming solutions like <a href="http://www.xmlpull.org">XML pull</a> and SAX. My basic lesson has been that streaming = performance. I mean, the numbers just don''t lie - we''re talking at least 3 times faster than any DOM-based solution in my benchmarking, often up to 10 times faster - depending on what you''re doing. The other big plus for SAX is that you get it for free with 1.4 so you don''t need to bundle stuff.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>The painful thing about SAX (and XML pull), which puts most people off, is that you end up tracking your own state while processing things. I used to end up setting a whole bunch of booleans "nowInsideName = true", "nowInsideAddress = true", then I bumped into a guy at our local <a href="http://www.cjugaustralia.org">JUG</a> who gave me a killer tip "Why don''t you use a Stack for state tracking?".

The problem is not the iterations - the problem is that I''m not planning them properly!\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aIn line with Alistair''s recommendations, I''m setting aside some time this week to make sure that our monthly iterations are better aligned to our end game.

What gets me is that the thing is so readable, and so practical. Some of the ideas that really shifted me were:\u000a<ul>\u000a<li><b>To-Dos without Dependencies</b>: Instead of putting incredibly broad items in your lists, make sure ever item has no dependencies. Don''t write "Fix lightbulb", write "Purchase 75W Bulb at Hardware".</li>\u000a<li><b>Categorise by Place</b>: Categorise the items in your todo list by the place where you actually do them! All my "online" stuff goes together, all my "desk" stuff goes together, all my "call people" stuff goes together. It saves stacks of time.</li>\u000a<li><b>Turn off the ding</b>: It''s not realistic to respond to all emails within 5 minutes. So turn off the popup ding. Do your email once or twice a day. If you get email after 5, and then reply at 9 the following morning, they''re waiting 16 hours already. So why not formalise and make sure that people get a response once a day. You''ll get more work done, and you''ll get more respect from them. Ditto for your phone, turn it off and give yourself some blocks of hours to get "in the zone". </li>\u000a<li><b>Collection points</b>: Most of us have around 25 collection points in our life - places we keep incoming information and notes. Multiple inboxes, voicemail boxes, sticky notes, notebooks from design meeting, bits of paper that we leave on the dining room table, you name it. The biggest of all is our head. The thing about your head is that all that stuff you cram in and seem to forget about goes into your subconscious and comes back to you when there''s space. Normally at 2AM in the morning. So instead of 25 collection points narrow it a half dozen. Everything actionable in my world goes into "Categories: None" - the Outlook "catch all" category. It stays here till I categorise it (by location, you''ll recall). These days, with the PDA around me most of the time, my recall is pretty much 100%. It all get captured. And in a single place. Even emails that require action get dragged there, so my inbox is no longer my "todo" list.</li>\u000a<li><b>And much, much, more</b>. I''ve gotta say this book is an essential read if you feel your world is disorganised. It is *so* worth it. \u000a</p>\u000a</ul>\u000a<p>\u000aI''ve been at "the program" for around 5 months and I''m still loving it.

Its got a very smick UI and seems to work pretty well as spec''d on the tin. The install is a matter of dragging the war file into your webserver, and (mostly) using the web ui to configure the rest. Little bit of commandline CVS stuff for your project by hand, but largely pretty much "just works" - so bit kudos to those guys.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aCruiseControl is a little more work for your result. There are xml config files to build and edit, there are cvs commandline things to do to get your directories setup (if you don''t want to hardcode passwords, etc). But you a rewarded with abuntant power for your investment. The doco is solid, and if you follow the worked example you''ll stay mostly out of trouble.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aTo capture some of the dramas I had: (all of which were resolved with the latest <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CC/Frequently+Asked+Questions">FAQ</a>)\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Couldn''t find my junit task in ant.... turns out I needed to modify my launching config.xml to use the <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CC/AntScriptAttribute">AntScript</a> attribute so that ANT_HOME was actually being located properly. \u000a<li>Couldn''t get CVS to recognise any changes in a tagged branch in my respository... which turns out needing to specify the "tag" attribute to match my branch name in the cvs call in config.xml.\u000a<li>Integrating nicely as a service under unix. I managed to find a nice Unix shell script via the FAQ that let''s you do all those nifty start/stop operations (and sets up the ports for the JMX console, which, if you don''t specify a -port on startup, ends killing off the Console page in your webapp).\u000a\u000a</ul>\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aOverall I''d say that, on first impressions, CC seems a lot more powerful than Anthill.

To query my event queue (an ArrayList) for events of a particular value, I can do stuff like:\u000a<pre>\u000aQuery q = new Query();\u000aq.parse("SELECT * from event.queue.Event where key = ''" + eventCode + "''");\u000aQueryResults qr = q.execute(eventQueue);\u000aif (qr.getResults() != null)\u000a\u0009return (Event[]) qr.getResults().toArray(new MonitorEvent[0]);\u000a</pre>\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aOf course this is something you *could* write by hand by iterating your collections and performing your custom checks on each iteration, but using JoSQL is just *way* more productive and intuitive - and you can express what you''re after very concisely.\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aYou can event do <code>ORDER BY</code> and all sorts of SQL goodness. Very cool stuff. And how performant is it? Well, compared with the database I was persisting this stuff to... let''s just say I''m a long way ahead...\u000a</p>\u000a<p>\u000aBig props to the guys at JoSQL.
